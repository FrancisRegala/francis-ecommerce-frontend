# Francis E-Commerce Frontend

This project is a standalone front-end implementation of an e-commerce homepage built as part of a front-end code challenge. The goal is to demonstrate clean structure, responsive design, and modern front-end best practices.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow the steps below to clone the project and run it locally in your browser.

---

## 📦 Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- **Git**
- **A modern web browser** (Chrome or Safari recommended)
- **Local web server** (optional but recommended)
  - Examples:
    - VS Code Live Server extension
    - XAMPP / MAMP
    - Any simple static file server

---

## 📥 Clone the Repository

Open your terminal and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FrancisRegala/francis-ecommerce-frontend.git
````

Then navigate into the project directory:

```bash
cd francis-ecommerce-frontend
```

## ▶️ Running the Project Locally

This is a **static frontend project**, so no build step is required.

### Option 1: Using a Local Web Server (Recommended)

Serve the project root directory using your preferred local server.

Once running, open your browser and navigate to:

```
http://localhost/francis-ecommerce-frontend/dist/
```

### Option 2: Open Directly in Browser

You may also open the compiled file directly:

```text
dist/index.html
```

However, using a local server is recommended to avoid any browser security restrictions.
